# Closure and Verification Records

This directory contains evidence-based completion records for implementation milestones. Adapted from `codegg/plans/closure/README.md`.

A closure record is not a retrospective summary alone. It is the gate that determines whether the corresponding subsystem milestone can be marked complete.

## Layout and naming

```text
closure/<subsystem>/NNN-status.md
```

Use the same milestone number as the source implementation plan. Subsystems: `calculator-core`, `exact-utilities`, `mcp-server`, `cli-distribution`.

## Required closure-record template

```markdown
# <Subsystem> Milestone NNN — Closure Status

Status: closed | conditionally closed | corrective pass required | blocked

Source implementation plan:

- `plans/implementation/<subsystem>/NNN-...md`

Source subsystem roadmap:

- `plans/subsystems/<subsystem>-roadmap.md#...`

Repository baseline reviewed: `<SHA>`

Implementation commits or pull requests:

- `<SHA or link>` — summary

## 1. Executive finding

State whether the milestone's actual capability or infrastructure boundary is complete and why.

## 2. Requirement-to-evidence matrix

| Requirement | Evidence | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | test, code, packaging, docs, runtime output | pass/fail/partial/not run | ... |

## 3. Production implementation evidence

Describe the landed ownership, calculator, exact/, protocol, CLI, packaging, and operational changes. Distinguish implemented behavior from planned but absent behavior.

## 4. Verification executed

### Commands run

```bash
# exact commands
```

### Results

Record pass, fail, timeout, environmental block, skipped scope, and relevant counts without concealing partial execution.

## 5. Invariant review

For each source-plan invariant, record evidence that it remains true.

## 6. Failure and recovery review

Cover applicable:

- timeout and child-process cleanup;
- cancellation races and queue overflow;
- duplicate delivery and idempotency;
- process restart and cache/config generation staleness;
- partial persistence failure;
- stale generation or lease;
- contention and resource release;
- malformed or unauthorized input;
- bounded event and artifact behavior.

## 7. Migration and compatibility review

Record packaging migration, backward compatibility, protocol negotiation, configuration behavior, rollback limitations, and legacy-path status.

## 8. Security review

Record evaluation safety, authorization enforcement, secret handling, path validation, privilege boundaries, denial-of-service bounds, redaction, and audit behavior as applicable.

## 9. Documentation and operations

List updated architecture documents, commands, operator diagnostics, static guards, and recovery instructions.

## 10. Unresolved findings

| Severity | Finding | Impact | Required action |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Severity guidance:

- critical — unsafe to merge or operate;
- high — core correctness or security contract incomplete;
- medium — important behavior incomplete but bounded;
- low — polish, maintainability, or optional evidence gap.

## 11. Roadmap disposition

State one:

- milestone closed and next dependency may proceed;
- milestone conditionally closed with named operational evidence outstanding;
- corrective implementation plan required;
- milestone blocked and reason;
- subsystem roadmap must be revised.

## 12. Registry updates

List changes required in `plans/registry.md` and the source subsystem roadmap.
```

## Closure rules

A milestone MUST NOT be marked closed when:

- only compilation or formatting was verified;
- required tests were not run and no justified substitute evidence exists;
- a user-visible capability has only internal infrastructure;
- a security or packaging requirement is unimplemented;
- an evaluation path, protocol era, profile contract, or build boundary still bypasses the required authority;
- a known high-severity defect remains;
- closure depends on unrecorded assumptions.

A milestone MAY be conditionally closed when production implementation is complete but named external or operational evidence cannot be obtained in the current environment. The condition, risk, and exact future evidence must be explicit.

## Corrective follow-up

When closure requires correction:

1. keep the closure record immutable except for factual corrections;
2. create a new implementation plan under the same subsystem;
3. reference every unclosed finding;
4. add regression tests or guards that prevent recurrence;
5. do not reopen unrelated closed scope.
